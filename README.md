## About the Project

This project is a React-based web application with a user-friendly, fast, and responsive interface, styled with **Tailwind CSS**. **Framer Motion** is used for animations. The website is designed to be fully compatible across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Features include dynamic product filtering, a modern slider, and a product image viewer where the product expands and collapses upon clicking.

- **React Router**: Used for page routing.
- **Axios**: An HTTP client used for API calls.
- **React Hooks**: Various React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, and `useReducer` were used for managing state, handling side effects, and optimizing performance.

## Features

- **Product Filtering**: The app allows users to filter products dynamically based on categories and other criteria.
